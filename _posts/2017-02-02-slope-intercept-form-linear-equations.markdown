Standard Form Linear Equations are in the form of $$ax+by=c$$.

In slope-intercept form ($$y=mx+b$$), the $$m$$ would be the slope of the line.

Which means we want to express the standard form equation in slope-intercept form.

$$ax+by=c$$

Subtract $$ax$$ from both sides:

$$by=-ax+c$$

Divide both sides by $$b$$:

$$y=-\dfrac{a}{b} x + \dfrac{c}{b}$$

This means the slope of any standard form equation is $$\boxed{-\frac{a}{b}}$$
